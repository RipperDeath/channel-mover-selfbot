# Setup

 - Add a .env file to folder
 

    TOKEN="token string here"
    
	

# How to use

While in a discord voice channel use the following commands:

    >move <user> <channel id/name> [number of times to move back and forth]

# TODO

 1. be able to move user without being in a vc, just needs another variable
 2. multiple users at a time
 3. perhaps a delay in which people think their fine and dandy then goes again
